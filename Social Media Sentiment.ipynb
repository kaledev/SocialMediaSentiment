Page 8: There is created a state board to be known as the State Election Board, to be composed of t̶h̶e̶ ̶S̶e̶c̶r̶e̶t̶a̶r̶y̶ ̶o̶f̶ ̶S̶t̶a̶t̶e̶ a chairperson elected by the General Assembly, an elector to be elected by a majority vote of the Senate of the General Assembly at its regular session held in each odd-numbered year, an elector to be elected by a majority vote of the House of Representatives of the General Assembly at its regular session held in each odd-numbered year, and a member of each political party to be nominated and appointed in the manner provided in this Code section. No person while a member of the General Assembly shall serve as a member of the board. This is one of a few provisions that strip power from the secretary of state and indirectly shift it to the legislature by creating a new chair of the State Election Board. Previously, the secretary of state had served in that role.\\n\\nThe law dictates that the newly created chair be “nonpartisan,” but the position is appointed through the partisan legislature. Voting rights groups say this amounts to the legislature’s exerting more control over the State Election Board and election oversight in general.\\n\\nThe provision does contain some partisan guardrails: In the two years immediately preceding a chair’s appointment, he or she cannot have been a candidate for public office or have made any political campaign contributions.\\n\\nBut it also looks an awful lot like a revenge move: Republican lawmakers are taking power away from Mr. Raffensperger, who infuriated Mr. Trump and some G.O.P. leaders in the state by rebuffing the former president’s fraud claims.\\n\\nThe secretary of state is removed as a voting member of the State Election Board. Page 11: The Secretary of State shall be t̶h̶e̶ ̶c̶h̶a̶i̶r̶p̶e̶r̶s̶o̶n̶ ̶o̶f̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶b̶o̶a̶r̶d̶ an ex officio nonvoting member of the board. Three voting members of the board shall constitute a quorum, and no vacancy on the board shall impair the right of the quorum to exercise all the powers and perform all the duties of the board. The board shall adopt a seal for its use and bylaws for its own government and procedure. This is a more direct attack on the powers of the secretary of state, effectively eliminating that person’s voice on the State Election Board.\\n\\nViewed through the lens of the 2020 election, this could be seen as revenge for Georgia Republicans against the current secretary of state, Mr. Raffensperger, who would not capitulate to Mr. Trump’s demands to overturn the results under a false banner of fraud.\\n\\nThe G.O.P.-led legislature is empowered to suspend county election officials. Page 11: The State Election Board may suspend county or municipal superintendents and appoint an individual to serve as the temporary superintendent in a jurisdiction. Such individual shall exercise all the powers and duties of a superintendent as provided by law, including the authority to make all personnel decisions related to any employees of the jurisdiction who assist with carrying out the duties of the superintendent, including, but not limited to, the director of elections, the election supervisor, and all poll officers. (g) At no time shall the State Election Board suspend more than four county or municipal superintendents pursuant to subsection (f) of this Code section. Another power play by Republican state lawmakers. Tensions have long simmered between state and county election officials in Georgia, particularly in Fulton County, the largest Democratic hub in the state, where officials say they have been targeted and deprived of support by Republicans at the state level. Election officials in Fulton County, for their part, have had their historical share of mistakes and mismanagement.\\n\\nNow the State Election Board, newly influenced by the partisan Legislature, will have the power to suspend county election officials. That part of the new law alarmed some Democratic legislators, who noted that it could particularly affect counties like Fulton, which contains 15 percent of those in the state who voted Democratic in the November election.\\n\\nThe law does state that the bar for suspension is high: either a minimum of three clear violations of State Election Board rules, or “demonstrated nonfeasance, malfeasance, or gross negligence in the administration of the elections” in two consecutive elections.\\n\\nIn the event of a suspension, the State Election Board would name a temporary replacement.”',\n",

To hear republicans tell it there are millions of people voting illegally every election and yet no matter how hard they’ve tried to prove this they’ve failed. This is simply not the problem it’s being portrayed as - it is a hamfisted attempt to just make it harder to vote. Each incremental increase in difficulty will result in a percentage of people not voting. This largely favors the republicans because their voters always vote in every election no matter what. But if they can shave a few points off of independents - who may or may not vote GOP - and shave a few more from minorities and young people who favor Dems and who have a harder time taking time off to meet each new requirement then they can eek out a victory in close races. Trump convened an investigation to great fanfare to expose all of this supposed corruption at the beginning of his term and it ended up dissolving quietly a few years later having found nothing.

Unlike in 2016, we did not see persistent Russian cyber efforts to gain access to election infrastructure. We have high confidence in our assessment; Russian state and proxy actors who all serve the Kremlin's interests worked to affect US public perceptions in a consistent manner. A key element of Moscow's strategy this election cycle was its use of proxies linked to Russian intelligence to push influence narratives— including misleading or unsubstantiated allegations against President Biden — US media organizations, US officials, and prominent US individuals, including some close to former President Trump and his administration.\",\n",

Doing so highlights that the Conservative subreddit tends to skew more towards a more negative sentiment, while Liberal and NeutralPolitics subreddits tend to sit <i>more</i> in the middle (although we're dealing in very small percentages here).\n",

If the problem is solved by affirmative action, then the problem is solved. The motivation and justification for further changes won't be there. \\n\\nAll of what Im talking about is under the most optimal conditions too. This stuff can go very dark and very oppressive.

       " [\"To your first point:\\n1. Looking back at my previous comments, I still don't see where I acknowledged that the two were the same. The crux of my argument is that limiting free speech in the private sector (like Reddit, Facebook, Twitter, any social media) CAN and historically does lead to infringement of free speech by the government. Given the political climate and state of how most of the world choses to communicate (social media) you can see how limiting and manipulatig free speech does achieve the same affect. It's under the guise of private sector but clearly there are political associations. You don't need to constitutionaly remove someone's rights to free speech in order to silence their freedom of speech\\n\\n2. I agree that media conglomerates are motivated by money. Would the media completely silence right or left winged ideologies now? Very unlikely. It wouldn't be very profitable. But like you said, media is driven by money and can be manipulated by money to silence or promote certain viewpoints. Absolutely happens all the time. There isn't anything fundamentally wrong with business,  but clearly you can see where there is room for unjust manipulation. If all it takes is money, then that's hardly a barrier. There are billionaires who would love to silence our source of information. In fact, some would say entire countries may be interested in manipulating how Americans view and source information. \\n\\n3. The issue of defining hate speech is difficult to me. On one end people have the right to say whatever they want as long as you don't threaten their lives, threaten to harm them, or threaten their property. Thats our current standing of freedom of speech. Hate speech is a recent social invention that attempts to further limit what can and can not be said. I don't have a solution to the rhetoric of hate speech but I don't believe that infringement on fundamental speech rights (via social media) is the correct answer. I'm open to hearing suggestions. \\n\\n4. For one very immediate example, many right winged LGBT subreddits were banned today. No examples were provided for their use of hate speech. Obviously some major hate driving subreddits were rightfully banned for promoting violence, but again, this already falls under our constitutional definition for protected speech. \\n\\nDuring the civil rights movement (when the media was right leaning) , the government tried to silence African American voices entirely. Too many examples for me to site, I recommend doing some reading if you're really interested.  Symbolic speech was made illegal when protesters attempted to wear a black sleeve in protest of the Vietnam war. Black media entirely was not a thing. This was by design to limit speech of African Americans who were rightfully pushing for civil rights . Flag burning was recently made legal again as a valid form of free speech. What about the Red Scare during the cold war. I don't have exact figures but people lost their careers, thrown in political prisons, forced to leave the country. All because the US government tried to intervene in the freedom of expression and was used as a tool to justify spying and intelligence gathering on US citizens. Currently in Russia (and many other countries for that matter) there are active surveillance by the government against their people in an attempt to censor information that the current government views as extremist or against traditional views. \\n\\nAll these examples are extreme (obviously) but they don't start out that way. They start out with suggestions, then the local governments and states get involved, then it goes up the chain from there. \\n\\nAll that being said, I see  speech being manipulated to drive out narratives people don't agree with. I believe that is fundamentally wrong and dangerous to everyone. With how fluid politics are, there is no guarantee your views won't be on the chopping block next. To clarify, I'm not speaking about clear examples of hate speech (this is already covered by the 1st amendment) but the manipulation of the definition of hate speech and how that can ultimately lead to loss of free speech for all citizens.\",\n",
